# Hi, I'm Ollie

Small dev on a couple of open source projects. Love to collaborate on projects and with other people.

I'm on discord at `Ollie#0175` so feel free to send me a message there :)

I also host a hastebin [here](https://paste.ollieee.xyz/) for anyone to use for anything they need

This is a wrapper I have written in python for the Rust+ mobile API for interfacing with the server. See [Here](https://github.com/olijeffers0n/rustplus) for more info and join our discord here:
